                        <p>California's "lost coast" is a place where the climate has not been affected by its proximity to the mainland. This area covers just 1% of California's coastline, but it is home to the remaining coastal redwood forests. There are seven species of redwood trees growing in this area over equal distances from the Pacific Ocean and Bodega Bay on one side, to Eureka and Mendocino on the other side. They're all different from each other with their own unique characteristics, but they do share one thing in common: The weather here is extraordinary.</p>
